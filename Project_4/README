# 📊 Project 4: Tool-Based Linear Regression & Geospatial Visualization

This project explores predictive modeling using visual data mining tools and geospatial visualization in R. It focuses on hands-on experience with regression tasks using WEKA, KNIME, and RapidMiner, and spatial computation using `geosphere` and `leaflet`.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **WEKA**: Linear Regression on Boston Housing dataset.
- **KNIME**: Regression and workflow automation on the Abalone dataset.
- **RapidMiner**: Regression model building using drag-and-drop operators.
- **R (geosphere, leaflet)**: Geographic coordinate analysis and web map visualization.

## 📌 Tasks Completed

### 🧮 Linear Regression Models
- Trained and evaluated linear regression models using:
  - **WEKA**: Applied regression on the **Boston Housing** dataset; analyzed root mean squared error and attribute importance.
  - **KNIME**: Processed the **Abalone** dataset to predict age from physical measurements using regression nodes.
  - **RapidMiner**: Designed a drag-and-drop pipeline to train a linear regression model and generate performance metrics.

### 🗺️ Geospatial Analysis in R
- Calculated the **centroid** of a polygon formed by 6 user-defined GPS coordinates.
- Used the `geosphere` package to compute centroid coordinates.
- Visualized the result on an interactive web map using the `leaflet` library.

## 📈 Outcomes

- Gained practical exposure to popular **no-code machine learning tools**.
- Compared regression performance across tools using error metrics.
- Built an interactive **map-based geographic insight** using R scripting.
