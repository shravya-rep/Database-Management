# Project Portfolio Summary

This repository showcases four comprehensive projects demonstrating skills in database design, SQL querying, spatial data analysis, and data mining using both tools and R programming.

## ü¶∑ Project 1: Conceptual Database Design for a Dental Practice
- **Overview**: Designed an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram using Crow‚Äôs Foot Notation for a new dental clinic‚Äôs operations.
- **Scope**:
  - Models patients, appointments, insurance, procedures, billing, staff, and inventory.
  - Includes assumptions and design choices documented.
- **Tools Used**: draw.io / yEd / Visio (any ER tool).
- **Key Skills**: Conceptual DB design, abstraction, business logic modeling.

## üíª Project 2: SQL Implementation & Queries on Dental Database
- **Overview**: Implemented the Project 1 design in Oracle Live SQL with custom data and real-time queries.
- **Highlights**:
  - Created SQL tables and populated them with sample data.
  - Queries include average procedure cost over time, daily income, and employee task-based filtering.
  - Custom query written and explained for real-world utility.
- **Skills Used**: SQL (DDL + DML), filtering, aggregation, joins, subqueries.

## üåç Project 3: Geospatial Data Handling & Visualization
- **Overview**: Collected spatial data (lat/long) of 13 real-world locations and performed spatial queries.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Created a KML file with placemarks and visualized using Google Earth.
  - Executed spatial queries using PostGIS/Oracle Spatial: convex hull & nearest neighbors.
  - Used OpenLayers and HTML5 localStorage to display maps on a web page.
  - Generated and visualized a Spirograph curve overlaying real-world locations using KML and ArcGIS.
- **Skills Used**: KML, PostGIS, Oracle Spatial, OpenLayers, Google Earth, ArcGIS.

## üìä Project 4: Data Mining using WEKA, KNIME, RapidMiner, and R
- **Overview**: Applied linear regression and spatial data analysis using tool-driven workflows and R libraries.
- **Breakdown**:
  - Used Boston Housing data (WEKA) and Abalone shell data (KNIME & RapidMiner) for regression analysis.
  - Generated models and interpreted equations visually.
  - Used R packages `geosphere` and `leaflet` to compute and visualize convex hull centroid and mapping.
- **Skills Used**: GUI-based data mining, ARFF file handling, R spatial analysis & visualization.

---

## üöÄ Technologies & Tools
- **ER Design**: draw.io, Crow's Foot Notation
- **Databases**: Oracle Live SQL, Postgres + PostGIS
- **Visualization**: Google Earth, KML, ArcGIS, OpenLayers, Leaflet.js
- **Tools**: WEKA, KNIME, RapidMiner, R, RStudio

## üìå Summary
This set of projects provides a strong foundation in both backend (databases and spatial analysis) and frontend (map-based and tool-based visualization) tasks. Ideal for roles involving data engineering, analytics, GIS, and full-stack data workflows.
