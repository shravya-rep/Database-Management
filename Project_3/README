# 🌍 Geospatial Data Handling and Visualization

This project demonstrates end-to-end spatial data processing using KML, PostGIS, OpenLayers, and ArcGIS. The goal is to collect, organize, query, and visualize real-world location data, integrating both backend and frontend geospatial tools.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Collect geolocation data across real-world locations (USC campus + residence).
- Store and categorize the data in a `.kml` file for Google Earth.
- Perform spatial queries like Convex Hull and Nearest Neighbors using PostGIS.
- Build an interactive map-based web interface using OpenLayers.
- Create and visualize a Spirograph pattern overlaid on a real map using shapefiles.

## 🧱 Project Components

### 📍 1. KML Creation
- Generated `.kml` file with 13 placemarks across 4 categories:
  - Academic Buildings
  - Coffee Shops
  - Water Points
  - Emergency Phones
- Visualized in **Google Earth** with labeled placemarks and custom styling.

### 🧮 2. Spatial Queries with PostGIS
- Created a **Convex Hull** around all locations.
- Queried **4 Nearest Neighbors** to a reference point.
- Exported query results as KML lines and points for visualization.

### 🧭 3. Interactive Mapping with OpenLayers
- Stored spatial data in the browser using `localStorage`.
- Rendered a web-based map using **OpenLayers** with categorized markers and custom icons.
- Created interactive layer toggling for each location type.

### 🎡 4. Spirograph Curve Generation
- Used parametric equations to generate spirograph curves centered on Tommy Trojan.
- Converted coordinates to a **shapefile** and visualized in **ArcGIS Online**.
